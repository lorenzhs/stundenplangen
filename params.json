{"name":"Stundenplangen","body":"### Welcome to StundenplanGen.\r\nThis is StundenplanGen, a small script to convert dumps of KIT's Vorlesungsverzeichnis (university calendar). Sadly, the only available option is \"export to PDF\", downloading your schedule as an iCal file is not possible. This is where StundenplanGen comes in: You go to your lectures' detail view pages, grab all the contents from your browser window and save them to a file. Then you call StundenplanGen on those files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python stundenplan.py infile1 [infile2 [infile3 [...]] schedule.ics\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou're now ready to import your schedule into your favorite calendar application.\r\n\r\n### Problems?\r\nIf stuff breaks for you, please file a bug and I'll do my best to fix it. And please, do me a favor, don't look at the code. It's ugly.","tagline":"Generate an iCal calendar for lectures at KIT","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
